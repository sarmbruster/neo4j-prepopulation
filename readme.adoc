# Neo4j Docker image supporting initial graph setup

The https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/[official Neo4j docker image] does not support initial data population. This tiny project extends the docker image by this feature.

# Usage

Using env variable `NEO4J_INITIAL_CYPHER_URL` you can supply a URL that is loaded via https://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] and the URL's content get applied to Neo4j using https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/cypher-shell/[`cypher-shell`] *before* the server is started.

	docker run --rm -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/123 -e NEO4J_INITIAL_CYPHER_URL="https://docs.google.com/a/neotechnology.com/document/export?format=txt&id=1950KfQFbJ5RQ7obhIjxcUfNBrLM2u2FsWAOiNBZ0RXM&token=AC4w5VivcnYhmSrR03m68YSE87fPG8oMYA%3A1485261691857" -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 sarmbruster/neo4j-prepopulation:latest

some hints:

. different cypher statements in the script need to be separated by semicolons - see `cypher-shell` docs
. while downloading the file via cURL existing byte order marks (BOM) will be stripped.
. when using a google doc, select "export as textfile" and use the URL from there.
. if authentication is used via `-e NEO4J_AUTH=uid/pwd` these credentials are used for the population as well
. the docker image automatically has https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[apoc] and https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/spatial[Neo4j Spatial] aboard
